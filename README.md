# TodoApp

A simple and straightforward web-based TodoApp application, created just for fun during my spare time. While it's currently basic, I have exciting plans to add more advanced features and a backend in the future.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Easily add tasks to your to-do list.

## Demo

Check out a working demo of the app on YouTube: [Simple TodoApp](https://youtu.be/UUymtXWic6w?si=NeZtMLf2zBqz5Q77).

### Get Started

Here's how you can quickly get started with the TodoApp:

1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/sudayanga/TodoApp.git`
2. Open `index.html` in your browser.


### Feature Plans

My future plans for the TodoApp include:

- **Task Priority**: Assign priorities to tasks.
- **Task Categories**: Organize tasks by categories or projects.
- **User Accounts**: Create user accounts to save and sync your tasks.
- **Notifications**: Set reminders and receive task notifications.
- **Backend Integration**: Add a backend server to store tasks securely and manage user accounts.
- **Mobile Compatibility**: Optimize the app for mobile devices.

These features will make the TodoApp List App even more powerful and useful in your daily life.
